# Building Materials Delivery Program

This Python program is designed to assist the manager of a building materials delivery service in ensuring accurate orders. It checks the contents and weight of sacks, verifies customer orders, and calculates the price for orders.

## Description

The program is organized into three tasks, each serving a specific purpose:

1. Task 1 - Check the contents and weight of a single sack:
   - Accepts user input for the type (cement, gravel, or sand) and weight of a sack.
   - Validates the contents and weight according to specified rules.
   - Outputs whether the sack is accepted or rejected, along with clear rejection reasons if applicable.

2. Task 2 - Check a customer’s order for delivery:
   - Collects the number of sacks of each type required for a customer's order.
   - Utilizes Task 1 to validate the contents and weight of each sack.
   - Outputs the total weight of the order and the number of rejected sacks.

3. Task 3 - Calculate the price for a customer’s order:
   - Extends Task 2 to calculate the price for the order.
   - Defines prices for each sack type and a discount price for a special pack.
   - Outputs the regular price for the order and, if applicable, the discounted price and amount saved.

## Features

- Clear and meaningful prompts guide the user through each step of the program.
- Error messages are provided in case of rejected sacks, indicating the reasons for rejection.
- The program calculates both regular and discounted prices for customer orders.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

Ensure the reliability and correctness of the program by running provided test cases or creating your own. Test various scenarios to confirm that the program behaves as expected and handles different input conditions.
